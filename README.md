# Crop Production Analysis

## Overview
The **Crop Production Analysis** project is a data-driven exploration of agricultural trends and patterns in India. By leveraging SQL and a comprehensive dataset, the project aims to uncover insights into crop production, cultivation practices, and regional agricultural dynamics. The analysis seeks to assist policymakers, farmers, and stakeholders in making informed decisions to improve agricultural efficiency.

## Features
- Identify top crops based on production volume.
- Analyze crop yield and production trends over time.
- Explore regional and seasonal variations in crop cultivation.
- Investigate the relationship between cultivation area and production.
- Provide actionable insights for agricultural improvements.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). It has been loaded into MySQL Workbench for analysis. The dataset includes information on:
- Crop types
- Production volumes
- Cultivation areas
- Seasonal and regional data (state, district, year)

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: For scripting and backend support.
- **SQL**: For querying and data analysis.
- **MySQL Workbench**: To host and manage the dataset.

## Key Questions Explored
The project addresses the following questions:

1. What are the top three crops grown in India based on total production?
2. Which state has the highest average yield per hectare for rice cultivation?
3. What is the most commonly cultivated crop during the Kharif season?
4. How has the total area under cultivation changed from 1997 to 2014?
5. Which district has the highest production of coconut in the year 2010?
6. What is the overall trend in the production of sugarcane in India over the years?
7. Which state shows the highest variability in the production of wheat?
8. What is the average crop production per year?
9. Which district has the highest production?
10. How do crop area and production correlate?
11. Which year recorded the highest production?
12. How does coconut production compare between coastal and non-coastal states?
13. Is there a relationship between the area under cultivation and production of major crops in specific regions?

## How to Run the Project
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/pranay2331/Crop-Production-Analysis>
   ```
2. **Set up the MySQL database**:
   - Import the dataset into MySQL Workbench.
   - Ensure the database connection is properly configured.
3. **Execute SQL scripts**:
   - Run the provided SQL script `Crop_Production_Analysis.sql` to analyze the data.
4. **Interpret the results**:
   - Use the outputs of the queries to answer the research questions.

## Results
Key findings and trends will be documented here as the analysis progresses.

## Future Scope
- Automate the analysis using Python and integrate visualization tools such as Power BI or Matplotlib.
- Expand the dataset to include global agricultural data.
- Develop a web application to provide interactive insights.
